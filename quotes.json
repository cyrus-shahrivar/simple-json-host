    "quote": "We deliberate not about ends, but about means. For a doctor does not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade . . . They assume the end and consider how and by what means it is attained, and if it seems easily and best produced thereby; while if it is achieved by other means, they consider how it will be achieved and by what means this will be achieved, until they come to the first cause . . . and what is last in the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming. (Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, 3, 1112b)"
